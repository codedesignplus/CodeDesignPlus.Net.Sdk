## About The Project
The `CodeDesignPlus.Net.Event.Sourcing` project is designed to provide a framework for implementing Event Sourcing in .NET Core applications. It facilitates the management and storage of domain events, allowing for the reconstruction of aggregate states and enabling robust event-driven architectures.

### Key Features
1. Event Capture: Simplifies capturing domain events in your application.
2. Event Storage: Supports efficient storage of events for future retrieval.
3. Event Replay: Facilitates the replaying of events to rebuild application state.
4. Scalability: Designed to support scalable event-driven architectures.
5. Integration: Seamlessly integrates with other CodeDesignPlus.Net libraries for a cohesive development experience.

## Installation
To install the package, run the following command:
```bash
dotnet add package CodeDesignPlus.Net.Event.Sourcing
```

## Usage
For more information regarding the library, you can visit our documentation at [CodeDesignPlus Doc](https://doc.codedesignplus.com)
